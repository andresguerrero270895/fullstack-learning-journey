// === PROMISES THE ELEGANT SOLUTION ===

/*
 A promise is an object that represents the FUTURE
 result of an asynchronous operation.

 States of a promise : 
 -PENDING: Waiting (has'bt finished yet)
 -FULLFILLED: Completed (finished successfully)
 -REJECTED: Rejected (there was an error)

 It's like when you order food for delivery: 
 -They give you a tracking number(promise)
 -Status: "Being prepared" (pending)
 -Status : "Delivered" (fulfilled) or "canceled" (Rejected)
